# Intro

From the moment I printed the “Hello World” in the console of my
first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of
programming, But programming was never been “just a side hustle”
for me, it’s offered me an engaging challenge to continually learn
and improve my skills in creating high-quality applications. What
started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged
passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.

# Currently
I'm diving into competitive programming to challenge myself and refine my problem-solving abilities. I'm excited to focus on this path for the next 6 months to a year and see where it leads. I'm always open to new opportunities, but this will be a great foundation for my growth.

# Some history

- My parents bought a laptop in 2011 when I was 7. It was an old
HP that ran Windows 7. My favorite games were Road Rash,
Mortal Combat, GTA Vice City, House of the Dead and Mostafa.
In less than three months, I damaged the space button by
hitting it nonstop while playing video games.

- One of my uncles works as a software engineer. When I was 8, I
asked my mom what was actually his job. My mom replied that he
creates games that I play on my computer. On that day, I
decided to create video games instead of playing them.

- At the age of 11, I migrated to Dhaka, the capital city, and
was accepted into Rajuk Uttara Model School and College,
Bangladesh's finest school. For the next six years, RUMC was
my alma mater. Its setting and environment, teachers,
activities, and fellow classmates all played a significant
role in shaping who I am now.

- In 2016, I got the novel "1971 by Humayun Ahmed" as a prize
for obtaining the highest marks in my grade. It was the very
first novel of my life. I was so taken with Humayun Ahmed's
writing that I read the entire book in one sitting. I did not
sleep that night. I was giddy with anticipation of finishing
the book. Each chapter had a different mystery and was more
engaging than the others.

- When I was 12 years old, on the boundaries of RUMC, a new club
was established. Rajuk College Robotics & Technology Club was its
name. Computer Programming and Robotics were two important
aspects of this club. As I was determined to be a coder, I
joined that club and started attending classes on programming.
But to be honest, I didn't get much out of the classes. They
did, however, encourage me in discovering my passion, for
which I am quite grateful.

- At the age 12-14, I began learning to code on my own. I looked up
websites on Google, watched YouTube tutorials, and studied
whatever programming books I could find. I learned Python, C,
and C++ during that time.

- The pandemic began in the year 2020. It affects people from
many walks of life in various ways. It had both beneficial and
negative effects on me. One of the bad consequences was not
being able to spend time with my friends and near ones. But,
if I overlook those factors, this year has been nothing but a
blessing for me. In this period, I began studying Web
Development (MERN Stack and Django). I also became part of a
few global developer communities (freeCodeCamp, BWC, EddieHub,
MLH). These communities have had a significant impact on my
coding career. Every single one of the community members was
extremely helpful to me. They mentored me whenever I had a
problem with one of my projects or was attempting to implement
a new idea. We collaborated on a number of tech-related
events.

- I wanted to contribute and give back to the IT communities
when I was 16 years old. That's why I started blogging, and
it's been a lot of fun sharing my expertise and experiences
through technical and non-technical writing.

- In 2020, I was sitting at my desk, bored, when a thought
sprung into my head. I assumed my classmates were bored as
well. Why don't I talk to them and show them how to program?
Then I chatted to a few of them about my plan. They were all
enthusiastic about the concept and ready to learn programming.
So I used Zoom to organize PyCampaign20. I guided them on how
to begin a career as a Python Developer and taught them the
fundamentals of Python programming in that campaign. That was
the origin story of me becoming a teacher. Since then,
teaching has always been an integral part of my journey.

- In 2021, One day, a question came to my mind, is there any
developer community in Bangladesh? I did a little research on
it for a few days. Eventually, I realized that yes, there are
a few such communities in Bangladesh. But the range of those
communities is very limited, most of the community only works
with university-level students, school-college students have
no opportunity. Some developer communities are
institution-based, that is, they do not work with students
from outside institutions. "The AS8 Organization" was
established to solve the problem. The main goal of our
organization is to form the first developer community in
Bangladesh where all developers irrespective of
age-institution-educational qualification will join, interact
with each other through various events and support each other
to grow their careers.

- 2022 is another remarkable year of my life. It is the year I got admitted into "Notre Dame College", the country's best college. I consider myself extremely blessed to
experience NDC's rich educational culture, aesthetic splendour,
excellent instructors, extensive extra-curricular activities
and supportive friends.  I believe, "Getting admitted to NDC" is the best decision of my life so far.

- I joined NDC with a few objectives in mind. Becoming the president of the Notre Dame Information Technology Club (NDITC) is one of such objectives. In the end, that objective was accomplished. For that reason, I was exceptionally involved in the club activities. I arranged a number of workshops, seminars, and events with my club friends, including two national fests, INIT 3.0 in March 2023 and INIT 4.0 in April 2024. We also worked on several club projects together. I had a great time and made a ton of captivating memories in my club along the journey.

- Apart from extracurricular club activities, my main goal was to concentrate on my curricular studies. My exceptional performance both in academics and club activities has led me to further accomplishments. I was awarded the prestigious "Honorable Mention Award" in my college.

- I took a number of admission tests in 2024 in order to get accepted into a university for higher studies. Eventually, I decided to get admitted for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). BUET is regarded as my nation's top engineering university.   While developing this website, I am just a fresher at BUET. Here at my institution, I'm hoping to learn a lot and have a great experience.
